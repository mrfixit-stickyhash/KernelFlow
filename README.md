KernelFlow is an interactive sandbox for learning and experimenting with low-level kernel optimization.

It lets you schedule instructions on memory and compute units, visualize hazards and stalls, and explore performance using cycle simulation and roofline models.

Inspired by discussions in the tinygrad community.
